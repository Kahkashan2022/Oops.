        "# Oops Questions\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects that combine data and behavior.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes (data) and methods (behavior).\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in OOP is an instance of a class that contains real values for the attributes and can perform actions using the class's methods.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential features, while encapsulation hides internal details by bundling data and methods within a class.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods in Python are special methods with double underscores (like __init__, __str__) used to define custom behavior for built-in operations.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " - Inheritance in OOP allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers like private (__), protected (_), and public attributes within classes to control data access.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__ that automatically runs when a new object of a class is created, used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class methods use @classmethod to access class-level data via cls, while static methods use @staticmethod and don't access instance or class data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding in OOP is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - A property decorator in Python (@property) is used to define a method as a read-only attribute, allowing access like an attribute while using method logic behind the scenes.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different objects to be treated uniformly while enabling each to respond differently to the same method call.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and typically includes one or more abstract methods defined using the ABC module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - OOP offers advantages like modularity, reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance through structured and organized code.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - A class variable is shared across all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object created from the class.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class, combining their behaviors and attributes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        " - The __str__ method returns a user-friendly string representation of an object, while __repr__ returns an unambiguous string for developers, often used for debugging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class, enabling access to inherited methods without explicitly naming the parent.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is called when an object is deleted, allowing cleanup of resources before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod defines a method that doesn’t access class or instance data, while @classmethod defines a method that accesses class-level data using cls.\n",
        " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows different subclasses to override the same method from a parent class, enabling method calls to behave differently based on the object type.\n",
        " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line by returning self from each method.\n",
        " 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function, enabling function-like behavior for instances of a class.\n",
